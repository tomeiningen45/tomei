Getting videos without hassle

Tudou - 2 steps:

[1] Use Firefox to go to tudou. Select the desired HTML block (such as
    a playlist), right click -> "Inspect Element" -> pull down list
    -> Copy Inner HTML.

    Save the HTML into a text file.

    tclsh tudou_html.tcl < in.txt > list.txt

[2] Edit list.txt if necessary, remove anything you don't want

    tclsh tudou_get.tcl list.txt

    This will automatically download all items in the list.txt and save them
    into data/<name>.f4v

    Note that if a file is already downloaded, it will not be downloaded again.

    If available, 480p will be downloaded. Otherwise 360p will be downloaded.
